# Code Refactor Starter Code
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title

This version of the website was refactored for better accessability. There are now descriptive sections throughout the index file to easily understand which sections correspond to the website content. Alt attributes were added to all image files, and one link was fixed. 
The CSS file was drastically condensed and reorganized. Comments were added for easier navigation.
